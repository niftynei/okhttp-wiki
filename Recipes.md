We've written some recipes that demonstrate how to solve common problems with OkHttp. Read through them to learn about how everything works together. Cut-and-paste these examples freely; that's what they're for.

#### [Synchronous Get](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/samples/guide/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/recipes/SynchronousGet.java)

Download a file, print its headers, and print its response body as a string.

The `string()` method on response body is convenient and efficient for small documents. But if the response body is large (greater than 1 MiB), avoid `string()` because it will load the entire document into memory. In that case, prefer to process the body as a stream.

```java
  private final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

  public void run() throws Exception {
    Request request = new Request.Builder()
        .url("http://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt")
        .build();

    Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();
    if (!response.isSuccessful()) throw new IOException("Unexpected code " + response);

    Headers responseHeaders = response.headers();
    for (int i = 0; i < responseHeaders.size(); i++) {
      System.out.println(responseHeaders.name(i) + ": " + responseHeaders.value(i));
    }

    System.out.println(response.body().string());
  }
```

#### [Asynchronous Get](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/samples/guide/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/recipes/AsynchronousGet.java)

Download a file on a worker thread, and get called back when the response is readable. The callback is made after the response headers are ready. Reading the response body may still block. OkHttp doesn't currently offer asynchronous APIs to receive a response body in parts.

```java
  private final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

  public void run() throws Exception {
    Request request = new Request.Builder()
        .url("http://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt")
        .build();

    client.newCall(request).enqueue(new Callback() {
      @Override public void onFailure(Request request, Throwable throwable) {
        throwable.printStackTrace();
      }

      @Override public void onResponse(Response response) throws IOException {
        if (!response.isSuccessful()) throw new IOException("Unexpected code " + response);

        Headers responseHeaders = response.headers();
        for (int i = 0; i < responseHeaders.size(); i++) {
          System.out.println(responseHeaders.name(i) + ": " + responseHeaders.value(i));
        }

        System.out.println(response.body().string());
      }
    });
  }
```

#### [Posting a String](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/samples/guide/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/recipes/PostString.java)

Use an HTTP POST to send a request body to a service. This example posts a markdown document to a web service that renders markdown as HTML. Because the entire request body is in memory simultaneously, avoid posting large (greater than 1 MiB) documents using this API.

```java
  public static final MediaType MEDIA_TYPE_MARKDOWN
      = MediaType.parse("text/x-markdown; charset=utf-8");

  private final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

  public void run() throws Exception {
    String postBody = ""
        + "Releases\n"
        + "--------\n"
        + "\n"
        + " * _1.0_ May 6, 2013\n"
        + " * _1.1_ June 15, 2013\n"
        + " * _1.2_ August 11, 2013\n";

    Request request = new Request.Builder()
        .url("https://api.github.com/markdown/raw")
        .post(RequestBody.create(MEDIA_TYPE_MARKDOWN, postBody))
        .build();

    Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();
    if (!response.isSuccessful()) throw new IOException("Unexpected code " + response);

    System.out.println(response.body().string());
  }
```
